# Precise Angle Detection of Rectangles Using Neural Networks
## Introduction
> The repository contains a code for the dataset code as well as the model code of neural network for precise angle detection.
> The dataset file generates 1200 grey scale imgaes for our training model. This also includes a corresponding angles labels in a csv file.
> The model is based on a [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) combined with [MLP layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) to optimize the traning.
